# FCAP

This project is a command line interface application developed in C for Linux as a programming exercise. I developed this while teaching myself C. The application transmits files, reads directories, and provides the server machine with many file directory tools for managing a client machine.

This project is no longer being maintained however extensions and refactoring will be made at a later date.
